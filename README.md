# Neurone
Machine Learning Basics
The program demonstrates the capabilities of a single neuron in computing. You can calculate currency rates, convert length measures. After 'COMPLETE' , you can enter the keyword 'new' to return to the training stage of the neuron. 
The greater the accuracy of training, the greater the deviations will be in the final result and vice versa.
Recommend accuracy of training: 0,01
